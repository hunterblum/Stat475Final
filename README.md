### Description

This project began by scraping data from Pro Football Reference. The data was then prepped for analysis using PCA, cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis. I used the 
current (2020 at the time) NFL season to predict on. In the end, I believe the analysis got 11/12 playoff teams correct. However, the analysis had no way to account
for the four division and two wildcard system the NFL used at the time. In the future, I would create a more advanced model that can account for this structure.
